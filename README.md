# Unlockers Skills Library

A reusable library of **agent definitions**, **skills**, and the **documentation** they
reference — for code review, testing discipline, refactoring, and getting PRs merged.

**Examples are Python. The rules are not.** Nothing here is tied to Python except the code
in the examples, and translating an example is something an agent does well on request —
so the examples stay short and concrete rather than being written five times. Git-platform
commands default to GitHub's `gh` CLI, with GitLab (`glab`) and Azure DevOps (`az`) noted
where they differ; the one skill that cannot be generalised says so in its name.

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) is the map — read that first if you are an agent working here, or
a human deciding where something new belongs. [`diagrams/`](diagrams/) has the visual
version: the [merger's lifecycle](diagrams/merger-lifecycle.md) and
[how the pieces relate](diagrams/library-map.md).

## Layout

```
agents/      Subagent definitions (autonomous task-performers)
skills/      Skills — task-scoped capabilities (SKILL.md per skill)
docs/        Reference documentation that the skills and agents point to
```

### Agents

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [`merger`](agents/merger.md) | Full PR merge lifecycle: push, enable auto-merge, monitor CI and reviews, fix, rebase on conflicts, escalate to human approval. |
| [`refactor`](agents/refactor.md) | Clean-code refactoring specialist — restructures without changing behaviour. |

### Review skills

All six share one contract — arguments, ref resolution, severity levels, report shape —
documented once in [`docs/review-protocol.md`](docs/review-protocol.md). Each skill below
adds a single lens. They are read-only: they report, they do not fix.

| Skill | Lens | Report |
|-------|------|--------|
| [`review-pr`](skills/review-pr/SKILL.md) | Catch-all: bugs, design, security, coverage in one pass | `code-review-issues.md` |
| [`review-complexity`](skills/review-complexity/SKILL.md) | Accidental complexity — defensive checks, redundant exception handling, over-engineering | `complexity-review-issues.md` |
| [`review-testing`](skills/review-testing/SKILL.md) | Test quality and coverage | `testing-review-issues.md` |
| [`review-architecture`](skills/review-architecture/SKILL.md) | Boundaries, seams, dependency direction | `architecture-review-issues.md` |
| [`review-security`](skills/review-security/SKILL.md) | Secrets, injection, authz, crypto, dependencies | `security-review-issues.md` |
| [`review-impact`](skills/review-impact/SKILL.md) | Blast radius; which suites must pass — run this *before* pushing | `impact-analysis.md` |

`review-pr` alone is enough for a small change. For anything substantial the focused passes
find more than the catch-all does, and they run in parallel.

### Other skills

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| [`write-tests`](skills/write-tests/SKILL.md) | Write or improve tests: fakes over mocks, whole-object assertions, short bodies. |
| [`adapter-contract-testing`](skills/adapter-contract-testing/SKILL.md) | Hold a fake and its real adapter to one shared contract, so the fake cannot drift. |
| [`bugszero-root-cause`](skills/bugszero-root-cause/SKILL.md) | Fix a bug by removing the design weakness that allowed it, not just the symptom. |
| [`legacy-3p`](skills/legacy-3p/SKILL.md) | Change legacy code in order: Protect with characterization tests, Prepare by refactoring, Produce with TDD. |
| [`scope-challenge`](skills/scope-challenge/SKILL.md) | Capture a feature request as a very short PRD, then challenge it for the smallest valuable scope before building. |
| [`quality-gate`](skills/quality-gate/SKILL.md) | Objective thresholds as a backstop for when review nudges don't land. Final CI stage, Claude Code hook, or both. |
| [`azure-devops-pr`](skills/azure-devops-pr/SKILL.md) | **Azure DevOps only.** PR review threads, replies, follow-up work items, auto-complete. Ships its own scripts. |

## Using It with Claude Code

These are plain Markdown definitions. To use them in a project:

- **Agents:** copy a file from `agents/` into `.claude/agents/` (or `~/.claude/agents/`).
- **Skills:** copy a directory from `skills/` into `.claude/skills/`. Each contains a
  `SKILL.md`; some (`quality-gate`, `azure-devops-pr`) also ship scripts and config.
- **Docs:** copy `docs/` alongside and keep the relative links intact, or adjust the paths.

The review skills and the merger agent take an optional PR/MR number or branch and default
to the current branch against `main`.

Skills that reference "the project's conventions doc" mean whatever your repo uses —
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
