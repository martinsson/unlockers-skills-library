# Working in This Repository

This is a library of agent definitions, skills, and the documentation they reference. It
holds no application code. Everything here is prose that an agent reads and acts on, so the
quality bar is whether an agent given only this file plus one skill would do the right
thing.

Copy this file to `CLAUDE.md` or symlink it if your tooling expects that name.

## The map

Three kinds of file, and the distinction matters when adding one:

| Directory | What lives there | Test for belonging |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|
| `agents/` | Autonomous task-performers with their own loop and stopping condition | Runs unattended for many steps and decides when it is done |
| `skills/` | Task-scoped capabilities invoked for one job | Has an obvious "I am now doing X" trigger |
| `docs/` | Knowledge that more than one skill needs | Two or more things link to it, or would if it existed |

A rule that only one skill uses belongs in that skill. A rule two skills use belongs in
`docs/` — otherwise the copies drift, which is exactly how the review protocol ended up
worded three different ways before it was extracted.

## What is here

**Reviewing.** [`docs/review-protocol.md`](docs/review-protocol.md) is the entry point: it
owns the invocation contract, the severity vocabulary, the report shape, and the rules every
reviewer obeys. The six `skills/review-*` skills each add one lens on top of it. Start
there before reading any individual reviewer.

**Testing.** [`docs/testing-rules.md`](docs/testing-rules.md) is the standard;
[`skills/write-tests`](skills/write-tests/SKILL.md) applies it,
[`skills/review-testing`](skills/review-testing/SKILL.md) enforces it with the help of
[`docs/testing-review-guide.md`](docs/testing-review-guide.md), and
[`skills/adapter-contract-testing`](skills/adapter-contract-testing/SKILL.md) covers the
risk the no-mocks rule creates — a fake that has drifted from what it stands in for.

**Changing code.** [`docs/bugfix-workflow.md`](docs/bugfix-workflow.md) and
[`docs/feature-workflow.md`](docs/feature-workflow.md) are the defaults, both test-first.
[`skills/bugszero-root-cause`](skills/bugszero-root-cause/SKILL.md) is the escalation when a
bug is the second of its kind. [`agents/refactor`](agents/refactor.md) restructures without
changing behaviour, guided by
[`docs/accidental-complexity-guide.md`](docs/accidental-complexity-guide.md) and
[`docs/design-patterns.md`](docs/design-patterns.md).

**Landing it.** [`agents/merger`](agents/merger.md) owns the merge lifecycle.
[`skills/azure-devops-pr`](skills/azure-devops-pr/SKILL.md) is the Azure DevOps
implementation of the PR-host operations it needs.

**The backstop.** Everything above nudges: reviewers report and hope, agents improve what
they are pointed at. [`skills/quality-gate`](skills/quality-gate/SKILL.md) is what runs when
the nudges do not land — objective thresholds against the codebase as it stands, last in
CI, catching the drift that accumulates when every individual review was right to pass.
It is the only thing here that reads the code rather than the diff, and the only thing that
cannot be reasoned with.

## Conventions for content

- **Examples are Python. The rules are not.** Do not expand an example into five languages —
  it lengthens the page without clarifying the rule, and translation is something an agent
  does well on request. Say "examples are Python" once and move on.
- **State the rule, then the consequence.** A rule an agent cannot see the cost of gets
  dropped the first time it is inconvenient.
- **Show the fix, not the principle.** "Do it like `path/to/file:45`" beats a paragraph.
- **Say when the answer is nothing.** Reviewers especially must be able to return an empty
  report without feeling they have failed.
- **Do not hardcode one project.** Organisation names, branch names, directory layouts and
  toolchain commands are inputs. `main` is the default base branch; `<run tests>` is a
  placeholder. Anything that cannot be generalised goes in the skill's name — see
  `azure-devops-pr`.
- **Platform commands default to GitHub `gh`**, with the GitLab and Azure DevOps equivalents
  noted where they differ.

## Adding a skill

1. Check whether it is a lens on something that exists rather than a new thing. Another
   reviewer is usually a section in an existing one.
2. `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with YAML frontmatter: `name`, `description`, and `args` if it
   takes any. The `description` is what gets matched against a user's request — write it to
   be found, listing the phrasings that should trigger it.
3. Put shared knowledge in `docs/` and link to it. Put scripts inside the skill directory,
   not in a repo-level `scripts/` — a skill has to be copyable on its own.
4. Add it to the README tables and to the map above.
